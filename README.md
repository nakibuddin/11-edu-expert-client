## Project Description:

* For client side we use react js, react bootstrap, react router and firebase to implement this website.

* For server side we use node.js, express.js and mongodb for database.

* This is a single page project, as we use react router, it fells a smooth transaction between traversal of the website.

* The purpose of this eLearning platform is that it creates a robust learning experience that feels like a classroom experience, offering the traditional classroom characteristics (like instructor-student interaction, Q&As, discussion, games, collaborative projects etc.)
    
* As this is a e learning service platform, user of this website can add reviews(as much as possible) for each and every services if he/she want.
